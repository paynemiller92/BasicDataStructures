## Overview

This library contains Java implementations of Basic Data Structures. The exercises and ADT's are taken from [Java Software Structures, by Lewis and Chase](https://www.amazon.com/Java-Software-Structures-Designing-Using/dp/0133250121). This library contains the following data structures:

- Stacks
- Queues
- Binary Trees
- Graphs
- Multi-way Trees
- Heaps

## Contribution Guide

If you wish to improve or add new exercises, please feel free! Just make sure that you:

-  Add unit tests covering sufficient inputs.
-  Ensure that the variables, parameters, functions, and classes are named appropriately as to acheive [self-documenting code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-documenting_code#:~:text=Self%2Ddocumenting%20code%20is%20ostensibly,symbol's%20meaning%2C%20such%20as%20article.&text=The%20code%20must%20also%20have,easily%20understand%20the%20algorithm%20used.).
-  Open a Pull Request and assign paynemiller92 as the reviewer.
